1.go to github
2.create a new repository
3. copy the url of the repository
4. go inside your folder through terminal
5. type the following command:
		
		a.git init
		
		b.git add .

				do this after every change

				The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, git add doesn't really affect the repository in any significant wayâ€”changes are not actually recorded until you run git commit .
		
		c.git commit -m "First Commit"

				f the user exits the editor without editing the message, the commit is aborted. This has no effect when a message is given by other means, e.g. with the -m or -F options. ... It allows you to create a commit with an empty commit message without using plumbing commands like git-commit-tree[1].

		d.git remote add origin "url of ur repository"
		
		e.git remote -v
		
		f.git push origin master

				Use git push to push commits made on your local branch to a remote repository. The git push command takes two arguments: A remote name, for example, origin. A branch name, for example, master.


Now type your github username and password when required and it's done now:]


use: git status :to know  about the status of the new repository

git clone "url of repository"
